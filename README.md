## Neighborhood Map project

* <img src="img/myMap.bmp"></img>

My application shows places on Google Map in Chennai that I have thoughtfully chosen previously.

To select places you can use the searchbar and start to type a word, the search being case insensitive, to show respective locations.

To know more information about selected places, you only need to click on the place and related Wikipedia links might appear if and the corresponding marker will bounce with an infowindow popping up. To close the infowindow you shall use the close x icon on the right upper corner of the window. To get all these information, you can also simply click on a marker.

I had much fun to select locations and build the application that I count to use during my trip to Chennai in Nov 2015, hopefully by the time as a FEND graduated student.
