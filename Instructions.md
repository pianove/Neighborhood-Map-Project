PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

1. Write code required to add a full-screen map to your page using the Google Maps API.
2. Write code required to add map markers identifying a number of locations you are interested in within this neighborhood.
3. Implement the search bar functionality to search and filter your map markers. There should be a filtering function on markers that already show up. Simply providing a search function through a third-party API is not enough. SEARCH BAR: Filters both the locations in the list view and the markers on the map.

LIST VIEW:Show locations that have been searched for, additionally clicking on a location activities its associated map marker.

MAP: Shows each searched location as a marker, each marker can be clicked and shows unique information about a location in an infowindow. Markers should animate when clicked (bouncing, color change)

Code is properly separated based upon Knockout's best practices following an MVVM pattern.

Student hard codes at least 5 locations in their model.

Searching and Filtering
We expect your application to provide a search/filter option on the existing map markers that are already displayed. If a list of locations already shows up on a map, we expect your application to offer a search function that filters this existing list. The list view and the markers should update accordingly in real-time. Simply providing a search function through a third-party API is not enough to meet specifications.
What does "errors are handled gracefully" mean?
In case of error (e.g. in a situation where a third party api does not return the expected result) we expect your webpage to do one of the following:
A message shows up to notify the user that the data can't be loaded, ORThere are no negative repercussions to the UI.



5. Add additional functionality using third-party APIs when a map marker, search result, or list view entry is clicked (ex. Yelp reviews, Wikipedia, Flickr images, etc). If you need a refresher on making AJAX requests to third-party servers, check out our Intro to AJAX course.

Application utilizes Google's Map API and one additional data API.

A geospatial/map representation of identified locations is provided. Markers are clickable, and change style.
